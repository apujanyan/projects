## Advanced Banking System Simulation:

### Write a program that simulates a bank system. The program should have classes for accounts, customers, and transactions. Accounts should have attributes such as account number, balance, and account type (e.g., checking, savings). Customers should have attributes such as name and contact information. Transactions should have attributes such as the account being debited/credited, the amount, and the transaction type (e.g., deposit, withdrawal). The program should allow customers to manage their accounts, view transaction history, and transfer funds. Use interfaces to implement classes for different types of accounts (e.g., individual, joint) and abstract classes for banking operations.
